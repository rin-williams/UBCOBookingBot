# This is a room booking bot for study rooms in the Commons Building at the UBCO

## This bot is not a finished project

### How to run:

- Download the script `bookingbot.py` and then store it in `/Users/(your username)` for `macOS` or `C:/Users/(your username)` for `Windows`. This is to make it convenient when running the actual program.

- You will need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed on your device. This program will not work without it.

- You must have latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your device.

- Once installed, run the program by opening `BookingBot.pyw` using `Python Launcher`.

- Make sure you have DUO Push set up with your phone.

- Fill out infos, and then the program will run.

### When running:

- If using UBCO wifi, you will not need to configure DUO push. If you are not using UBCO wifi, you will need to send DUO push.

- If you choose not to enter the right credentials, the program will not work and will ask you to rerun the program. Once you enter the right credentials, the program will save your credentials for next time in `UBBuserdata.dat` and automatically run in headless mode and log you on for the next time.
